Heres a simple introduction of following files.

- `cf.py`: this is my implementation of various collaborative filtering algorithms. Please refer to my report for more thorough explanations.
- `cluster.py`: this script implements reinforcement clustering, which is roughly the same as in the hw2.
- `utility.py`: handles file read/write and data representation.
- `predict.py`: entry point of my program. It runs different CF algorithms with corresponding arguments. `python predict.py` command would rerun all the experiments specified in the handout. 
- `prediction.txt`: the required predictions for test data. Produced using model-based CF with k=50, cosine similarity and weighted mean.
- `junjiah-HW4-Report.pdf`: my report.
- `README.md`: this document.

Have fun ;)
